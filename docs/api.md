# API Documentation

This file gives a practical overview of the API routes. It is not a full OpenAPI spec yet.

Most routes return JSON. Member and admin routes require the matching session.

## Public Prayer Cards

Returns public prayer cards.

Common query parameters:

```text
sort=recent | responses | updated

```

Used by the home page and prayer wall.

### `POST /api/home-cards`

Important fields:

```text

If no image is provided by the create page, the app can use the default generated thumbnail route.
